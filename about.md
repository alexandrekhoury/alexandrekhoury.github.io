I'm a physicist with experience in AI. On this page, I will post a few projects that I decided to do, either because it seemed cool or because I wanted to enhance my skills. Please have fun browsing through some of the selected projects I present.

I also have another blog in which I discuss philosophical ideas and my travel journey:
